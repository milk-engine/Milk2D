# Milk2d 🐄

**Milk2D** is a lightweight, hand-rolled 2D game engine written in Go, powered by Ebiten.

### It's focused on giving developers control over:

- Game objects and component systems
- Rendering and viewport culling
- Asset loading
- Physics
- Scene Management
- Input (mouse,keyboard,gamepad)
- Audio ('player',transitions)
- Particle systems (emitters,affectors,lifetime)
- Event systems (pubsub)
- Optimized Serializer
- Debugging Tools (fps,profiler,inspector,logs)

#### Built from scratch for the love of simplicity, performance, and a little dairy-themed charm.

## 🚧 Status

Currently in early development. Perfect for engine nerds and folks who want to build up from clean primitives.

## 🐮 Examples

```go
// TODO: show examples on each topic (i.e how to setup a cow sprite)
```
